Creating feature specifications involves detailing how each feature will work, its syntax, and its interaction with other parts of the language. Here are the feature specifications for your new programming language, based on the attributes you've specified:

### 1. Automated Imports

- **Description**: Automatically import necessary modules when their functions or classes are used.
- **Specification**:
  - The compiler will include a pre-processing step to analyze the code and infer required imports.
  - Default libraries and modules in the standard library are imported without explicit statements.
  - Custom or third-party modules require explicit import statements.
  - Syntax for explicit imports follows TypeScript's style.

### 2. Garbage Collection

- **Description**: Automatic memory management to prevent memory leaks and manage object lifecycles.
- **Specification**:
  - Incorporate a garbage collector in the runtime environment.
  - Objects are automatically deallocated when no longer in use.
  - No explicit syntax for memory management in the language.
  - Provide options for tuning garbage collection for performance optimization.

### 3. Class and Interface Definitions

- **Description**: Define classes and interfaces in a TypeScript-like syntax.
- **Specification**:
  - Classes use `class` keyword; interfaces use `interface` keyword.
  - Support for properties, methods, constructors, and access modifiers (public, private, etc.).
  - Inheritance using the `extends` keyword.
  - Interfaces to define contracts for classes without implementation details.

### 4. Pointer Abstraction

- **Description**: Default passing of variables by reference with an option to explicitly copy.
- **Specification**:
  - All function arguments are passed by reference by default.
  - The `copy` function or method can be used to create a deep copy of an object.
  - No explicit pointer syntax; handled implicitly by the language.

### 5. Object Creation

- **Description**: Simplify object instantiation.
- **Specification**:
  - Objects are created by calling the class name as a function without the `new` keyword.
  - Constructors are defined in the class and are called automatically during object creation.

### 6. Inheritance

- **Description**: Use inheritance like in TypeScript with the `extends` keyword.
- **Specification**:
  - Classes can inherit from other classes using `extends`.
  - Support for method overriding and base class method calls using `super`.

### 7. NULL Handling

- **Description**: Specific handling of null values.
- **Specification**:
  - `null` is used to represent the absence of a value.
  - Distinct from `0` or `undefined`.
  - The language will enforce null checks where appropriate.

### 8. Template Syntax

- **Description**: Generic programming features similar to TypeScript's templates.
- **Specification**:
  - Use angle brackets `< >` for defining generic types.
  - Allow generics in classes, interfaces, and functions.
  - Enable constraints and default types for generics.

### 9. Printing to Console

- **Description**: Simplify printing to the console.
- **Specification**:
  - Use `console.log()` for standard output.
  - Supports string interpolation and formatting.

### 10. `export` Keyword

- **Description**: Facilitate module exportation using `export`.
- **Specification**:
  - Use `export` before class, function, or variable to make them available for import.
  - Supports named and default exports.

### 11. Header Files

- **Description**: Eliminate the need for separate header files.
- **Specification**:
  - All definitions are contained within a single file.
  - The language handles declaration and definition without separate headers.

### 12. Memory Allocation

- **Description**: Automate memory allocation for objects.
- **Specification**:
  - Memory allocation for new objects is handled automatically.
  - The language runtime takes care of allocating the correct amount of memory based on the object type.

### 13. `#define` Keyword

- **Description**: Replace `#define` with `const`.
- **Specification**:
  - Use `const` for defining constants.
  - Constants are immutable and their types are inferred.

### 14. Threads

- **Description**: Implement threading using `async/await`.
- **Specification**:
  - `async` keyword marks a function as asynchronous.
  - `await` is used to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete.
  - The runtime handles thread creation and management.

### 15. `this` Keyword

- **Description**: Eliminate the need for the `this` keyword.
- **Specification**:
  - Implicit context binding in methods; `this` is not required or available.
  - References to properties or methods in the same class do not require `this`.

### 16. `auto` Keyword

- **Description**: Implicit type inference.
- **Specification**:
  - The language infers types automatically; explicit type declaration is not necessary.
  - The `auto`
