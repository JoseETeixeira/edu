#include "nodes.h"

// Since nodes.h is primarily a header with class definitions and we're not
// changing functionality, this file is mostly empty. Most of the class methods
// are inline in the header. This file is created to ensure proper separation
// of declaration and implementation.

// Any additional implementations of node methods can be added here if needed.
