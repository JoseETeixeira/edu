Basic Structure: The parser class will use the Tokenizer to read tokens and construct the AST using the nodes defined in nodes.h.

Top-Level Parsing: Implement methods to parse the top-level constructs - program, class declarations, function declarations, etc.

Recursive Descent Parsing: For each construct in your grammar, implement a method that parses that construct. This approach is known as recursive descent parsing.

Error Handling: Include error handling for unexpected tokens or syntax errors.
