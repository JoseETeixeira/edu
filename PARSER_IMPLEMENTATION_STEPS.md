### Implementation Steps

1. **Grammar Definition**

   - Define the syntax rules for variable declarations, function definitions, class and interface declarations, etc., in BNF or EBNF.

2. **Parser Development**

   Choose a Programming Language: Select a language for writing your parser. C++ or TypeScript could be suitable choices.

   Tokenization: Implement a tokenizer (lexer) that reads the source code and converts it into a list of tokens based on your language's syntax.

   Parsing: Develop the parsing logic that takes tokens from the tokenizer and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) according to your EBNF grammar.

   AST Node Definitions: Define classes or structures for different types of AST nodes (e.g., FunctionNode, ClassNode, VariableDeclarationNode).

   Error Handling: Implement error handling to manage syntax errors gracefully.

   Testing: Continuously test your parser with various code snippets to ensure it correctly interprets the language's syntax.

3. **AST Nodes Design**

   - Design different types of nodes for different syntactic constructs (e.g., `FunctionDeclarationNode`, `ClassDeclarationNode`, `VariableDeclarationNode`).

4. **Building the AST**

   - As the parser recognizes different constructs, instantiate the corresponding AST nodes.
   - Set up parent-child relationships between nodes to reflect the code's structure.

5. **Testing the Parser**
   - Write test cases covering various aspects of your language's syntax.
   - Test the parser with these cases to ensure it correctly generates the AST.
